## 1. Business Understanding
Ravelry.com is a database-driven website where users can browse and download knitting and crochet patterns, track their progress on a given project, and review the patterns. 

It currently has a "your pattern highlights" recommender system. Compared to the front-and-centre recommendations that Netflix or Amazon make to their users, it's tucked away at the bottom of the patterns search page, displaying only thumbnail images of the recommended pattterns. 

The recommendations generated appear to be based on clicks and/or favourites, rather than a more comprehensive examination of what projects users actually work on and rate positively, having experienced making them. 

The aim of this project is to provide more tailored recommendations for knitting patterns to users of Ravelry.com, based on patterns they have worked on and rated already.
